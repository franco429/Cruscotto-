# Google OAuth Verification - Scope Justification Request
## Application: Pannello di Controllo SGI - Document Management System

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Application Name:** Pannello di Controllo SGI  
**Scope Requested:** `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`  
**Additional API:** Google Picker API  
**Purpose:** Business document management and compliance tracking for regulated industries

Pannello di Controllo SGI is a professional document management platform designed to help businesses maintain compliance with regulatory requirements by synchronizing and monitoring documents stored in their own Google Drive folders. Our application requires read-only access to user-selected folders to provide document tracking, expiration alerts, and compliance reporting.

---

## 1. APPLICATION OVERVIEW & BUSINESS CASE

### 1.1 What the Application Does

Pannello di Controllo SGI is a web-based document management system specifically designed for businesses that need to:
- Track regulatory documents (certifications, licenses, quality documents)
- Monitor document expiration dates and receive alerts
- Maintain compliance with industry standards (ISO, safety regulations, etc.)
- Access a centralized dashboard for document oversight

**Key differentiator:** Unlike traditional document management systems that force users to upload files to a third-party platform, Pannello di Controllo SGI allows businesses to keep their documents in their own Google Drive while providing professional tracking and monitoring capabilities.

### 1.2 Target Audience

- Small to medium businesses requiring document compliance tracking
- Companies in regulated industries (manufacturing, healthcare, construction, etc.)
- Organizations that already use Google Workspace and prefer to keep documents in their existing Google Drive infrastructure
- Business owners and compliance officers who need visibility into document status

---

## 2. COMPLETE USER FLOW & AUTHENTICATION PROCESS

### 2.1 User Registration & Onboarding

**Step 1: Account Creation**
- User registers on the platform with email and password
- Each client receives a dedicated, isolated account
- Authentication is handled via bcrypt-hashed passwords (never stored in plain text)
- Session management via secure HTTP-only cookies with JWT tokens

**Step 2: Initial Setup**
- After login, new users are guided to the "Configurazione Google Drive" page (`clients-page.tsx`)
- Clear instructions explain the authorization process
- Users see their connection status: "Cartella non configurata" initially

### 2.2 Google Drive Authorization Flow

**Step 3: OAuth Authorization - Backend Authentication**

When a user clicks "Seleziona Cartella", the application initiates a two-phase authorization:

```
User clicks "Seleziona Cartella" 
    ↓
Application checks: Does user have OAuth tokens? 
    ↓
If NO tokens exist:
    → Opens OAuth consent screen in popup window
    → User grants 'drive.readonly' permission to the application
    → OAuth callback receives authorization code
    → Backend exchanges code for access_token + refresh_token
    → Tokens stored securely in MongoDB (encrypted at rest)
    → Tokens are NEVER exposed to frontend
    ↓
Application confirms: "Connessione riuscita!"
```

**Implementation details (from `clients-page.tsx` line 128-214):**
- OAuth popup window (500x600px) for secure authorization
- Backend endpoint `/api/google/auth-url/:clientId` generates state-validated OAuth URL
- User grants permissions on Google's official consent screen
- Authorization code exchanged server-side for security
- Refresh tokens stored per-client in database for automatic token renewal
- Timeout protection (5-minute limit) prevents hanging states

### 2.3 Folder Selection with Google Picker

**Step 4: Folder Selection**

After successful OAuth authorization:

```
OAuth completed successfully
    ↓
Google Picker API automatically opens
    ↓
User sees their ENTIRE Google Drive structure
    ↓
User navigates to and selects their business document folder
    (e.g., "Company Documents/Regulatory/Certifications")
    ↓
Application stores:
    - Folder ID (driveFolderId)
    - Folder name (for display)
    ↓
Configuration saved to client record
```

**Why Google Picker is essential:**
- Provides official Google UI for folder selection
- User maintains full control over which folder to share
- No need to request folder path manually
- Visual confirmation of selected folder
- Native Google Drive navigation experience

### 2.4 Document Synchronization

**Step 5: Initial Sync**

```
User clicks "Sincronizza Ora" (or automatic trigger)
    ↓
Backend service initiates sync process:
    1. Uses stored refresh_token to get fresh access_token
    2. Calls Google Drive API: list files in selected folder
    3. Reads file metadata:
       - File name
       - File type (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, etc.)
       - Last modified date
       - Drive file ID
    4. Parses document information (title, revision, expiration date)
    5. Stores metadata in application database
    6. NO file content is downloaded to our servers
    7. Creates document records with Drive URLs for future access
    ↓
User redirected to home dashboard
```

**Implementation (from sync flow):**
- Read-only operations: `files.list()` and `files.get()` for metadata
- Recursive folder traversal to include subfolders
- Document parsing to extract compliance information
- All file access remains in Google Drive (zero downloads)

### 2.5 Document Viewing & Management

**Step 6: Dashboard Usage (document-table.tsx)**

```
User views Document Dashboard
    ↓
Table displays all synchronized documents:
    - Document reference/path
    - Document title
    - Revision number
    - Status badge (Valid/Expiring/Expired)
    - Last updated date
    ↓
User actions available:
    - Preview: Opens Google Drive preview (drive.readonly scope)
    - View details: Shows document metadata
    - (Admin only) Delete: Removes from tracking system only
```

**Key security features:**
- Each user sees ONLY their own documents
- Database queries filtered by authenticated user ID
- No cross-client data leakage possible
- Row-level security enforced at API level

---

## 3. WHY `drive.readonly` IS REQUIRED (NOT `drive.file`)

### 3.1 The Fundamental Difference

**`drive.file` scope allows access to:**
- Only files that the application itself created
- Only files that the user explicitly opened via the app

**`drive.readonly` scope allows access to:**
- All files in user-selected folders (with user consent)
- Pre-existing files that the application did not create
- Read-only operations across user's chosen Drive folders

### 3.2 Why `drive.file` CANNOT Work for Our Use Case

**Critical incompatibility reasons:**

1. **Pre-existing Documents**
   - User documents already exist in their Google Drive BEFORE they use our application
   - These documents were created by the user or their organization, not by our app
   - `drive.file` would have ZERO access to these pre-existing files
   - Our entire business model depends on reading existing business documents

2. **No File Creation Required**
   - Our application does NOT create, upload, or modify any files in Google Drive
   - We are purely a READ-ONLY monitoring and tracking service
   - `drive.file`'s write capabilities are unnecessary and would request more permissions than needed
   - Users want to manage documents themselves; we only track them

3. **User-Managed Document Lifecycle**
   - Business users maintain their documents using Google Drive directly
   - They upload certifications, licenses, regulatory documents themselves
   - They organize files in folder structures that make sense for their business
   - Our app discovers and monitors these existing structures

4. **Folder-Based Architecture**
   - Users select an entire folder hierarchy for tracking
   - Documents may be nested in multiple subfolders (e.g., /Certifications/ISO/2024/)
   - `drive.file` cannot access folder structures the app didn't create
   - We need to traverse user-organized folder hierarchies

**Real-world scenario:**

```
❌ With drive.file scope:
User has folder: "My Company/Quality Documents/ISO 9001/"
    Contains: - ISO9001_Certificate.pdf (uploaded 2023)
              - Quality_Manual_v3.docx (uploaded 2024)
              - Audit_Report_2024.pdf (uploaded 2024)
    
User authorizes app → Selects this folder
App attempts to list files → RESULT: 0 files found
Reason: App didn't create these files, so drive.file denies access

✅ With drive.readonly scope:
User has same folder structure
User authorizes app → Selects this folder  
App lists files → RESULT: All 3 files accessible (read-only)
App can read metadata, show in dashboard, track expiration dates
User's documents remain safely in their Drive, fully under their control
```

### 3.3 Why Read-Only Is Sufficient AND More Secure

Our application design philosophy prioritizes:

**Data Sovereignty:**
- Users retain 100% ownership of their documents
- Files never leave Google Drive
- We never download file content to our servers
- Users can revoke access anytime via Google Account settings

**Minimal Privilege Principle:**
- We request ONLY what we need: read access
- We explicitly do NOT need write, delete, or modify permissions
- `drive.readonly` is the minimum viable scope for our functionality
- More restrictive than `drive.file` for modification capabilities

**User Trust:**
- Users can verify we have zero write access to their Drive
- Impossible for our app to accidentally or maliciously modify/delete files
- Audit trail clear: all changes to documents come from user, not app
- Transparent permissions during OAuth consent

## 4. SECURITY & PRIVACY ARCHITECTURE

### 4.1 Data Protection Measures

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- ✅ Bcrypt password hashing (cost factor 10)
- ✅ JWT tokens with secure secret rotation
- ✅ HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS attacks
- ✅ CSRF protection on all state-changing operations
- ✅ Session expiration and automatic logout
- ✅ Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

**OAuth Token Management:**
- ✅ Refresh tokens stored encrypted in MongoDB
- ✅ Access tokens never exposed to frontend/client
- ✅ Token refresh handled entirely server-side
- ✅ Per-client token isolation (one user cannot access another's tokens)
- ✅ Secure token exchange using authorization code flow (not implicit flow)
- ✅ State parameter validation prevents CSRF on OAuth callback

**Database Security:**
- ✅ MongoDB with authentication enabled
- ✅ Network encryption (TLS) for database connections
- ✅ Each client's data segregated by clientId foreign key
- ✅ No shared document pools between clients
- ✅ Parameterized queries prevent NoSQL injection
- ✅ Regular automated backups with encryption

**API Security (from `security.ts`):**
- ✅ Input validation on all endpoints
- ✅ Output sanitization prevents data leakage
- ✅ User-scoped queries enforce data isolation
- ✅ Admin-only endpoints protected by role checks
- ✅ Request logging for audit trail
- ✅ Error messages sanitized (no stack traces to client)

### 4.2 Privacy Guarantees

**Data Minimization:**
- We store ONLY metadata (filename, modification date, Drive ID)
- No file content downloaded or stored on our servers
- No document preview caching
- When user clicks "Preview", redirect directly to Google Drive's official viewer

**User Control:**
- Users choose exactly which folder to sync (via Google Picker)
- Users can change the tracked folder anytime
- Users can disconnect Google Drive authorization anytime
- Revoking OAuth access immediately stops all sync operations
- Users can delete their account and all associated data

**Multi-Tenant Isolation:**
```javascript
// Every database query filtered by authenticated user
const documents = await db.documents.find({
  clientId: authenticatedUser.clientId,  // ← Enforced isolation
  // ... other filters
});
```

- Complete logical separation between clients
- Impossible for Client A to see Client B's documents
- No shared folders or cross-client references
- Admin users can only see their assigned clients

**No Third-Party Data Sharing:**
- Zero data sold or shared with third parties
- No advertising or marketing use of user data
- No analytics on document content
- Google OAuth tokens never shared with external services
- Compliance with GDPR (EU users) and data protection regulations

### 4.3 Compliance & Audit

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- All Google Drive API calls logged with timestamp and user ID
- Failed authorization attempts logged for security review
- Document sync operations auditable
- Access logs retained for compliance review

**Transparency:**
- OAuth consent screen clearly states permissions requested
- In-app documentation explains what data is accessed
- Privacy policy and terms of service available
- Users notified of any scope changes via email

## 5. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### 5.1 Google Drive API Usage Patterns

**APIs Used:**
- `drive.files.list` - Enumerate files in selected folder
- `drive.files.get` - Retrieve file metadata (name, modified time, mimeType)
- Google Picker API - Folder selection UI

**APIs NOT Used (confirming read-only nature):**
- ❌ `drive.files.create` - We never create files
- ❌ `drive.files.update` - We never modify files
- ❌ `drive.files.delete` - We never delete files from Drive
- ❌ `drive.files.trash` - No trash operations
- ❌ `drive.permissions.*` - We don't manage sharing/permissions

**Request Frequency:**
- Automatic sync: Maximum once per hour per client (configurable)
- Manual sync: Rate limited to prevent abuse
- Webhook support planned (Drive API push notifications) to reduce polling

### 5.2 Code Evidence of Read-Only Operations

**From `google-drive-api.ts`:**
```typescript
// Example: List files in folder (read-only)
async listFilesInFolder(folderId: string, accessToken: string) {
  const response = await drive.files.list({
    q: `'${folderId}' in parents and trashed=false`,
    fields: 'files(id, name, mimeType, modifiedTime)',
    // ↑ Only reading metadata, never file content
  });
  return response.data.files;
}
```

**From `auto-sync-service.ts`:**
```typescript
// Sync process: read metadata only
async syncDocuments(clientId: number) {
  const files = await driveApi.listFilesInFolder(folderId, accessToken);
  
  for (const file of files) {
    // Parse filename for document info
    const docInfo = parseDocumentName(file.name);
    
    // Store metadata in our database
    await db.documents.upsert({
      title: docInfo.title,
      driveFileId: file.id,        // ← Link to Drive, not file download
      driveUrl: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/${file.id}`,
      lastModified: file.modifiedTime,
      // NO file content stored
    });
  }
}
```

### 5.3 Frontend Implementation

**From `clients-page.tsx` (lines 128-214):**
```typescript
// OAuth initiation with security measures
const handleGoogleDriveAuth = async (clientId: number) => {
  // 1. Request auth URL from backend (server-side state validation)
  const res = await apiRequest("GET", `/api/google/auth-url/${clientId}`);
  const data = await res.json();
  
  // 2. Open OAuth popup (user consent on Google's domain)
  const popup = window.open(data.url, "google-auth", "width=500,height=600");
  
  // 3. Listen for success message from OAuth callback
  const messageListener = (event: MessageEvent) => {
    if (event.data.type === "GOOGLE_DRIVE_CONNECTED") {
      // OAuth successful - tokens stored server-side
      // 4. Automatically open Google Picker for folder selection
      googleDrivePickerRef.current?.openPickerAfterAuth();
    }
  };
  
  window.addEventListener("message", messageListener);
};
```

**From `document-table.tsx` (lines 296-322):**
```typescript
// Document preview: read-only access to Drive files
<Button onClick={() => {
  if (!document.driveUrl) {
    // Local file fallback (for uploaded docs)
    openLocalDocument(document);
  } else {
    // Remote Drive file: use Google's preview
    // Requires drive.readonly to access pre-existing file
    onPreview(document);  // Opens Drive viewer iframe
  }
}}>
  <Eye /> Visualizza
</Button>
```

---

## 9. SCOPE ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS

We have thoroughly evaluated all Google Drive API scopes:

| Scope | Why Not Suitable |
|-------|------------------|
| `drive.file` | ❌ Cannot access pre-existing user files (deal-breaker) |
| `drive.appdata` | ❌ Only for app-specific hidden folder, not user documents |
| `drive.metadata.readonly` | ❌ Insufficient: need folder navigation and file type info |
| `drive` | ❌ Excessive: includes write/delete permissions we don't need |
| `drive.readonly` | ✅ **Perfect fit:** Read existing folders/files, no write access |

**Conclusion:** `drive.readonly` is the minimum viable scope that enables our core functionality while maximizing user security.

---

## 10. CONCLUSION & COMMITMENT

### 10.1 Summary

Pannello di Controllo SGI requires `drive.readonly` scope because:

1. **Business Model:** We monitor pre-existing user documents, not create new ones
2. **User Experience:** Users keep documents in their own Drive, we just track them
3. **Security:** Read-only access prevents any accidental or malicious modifications
4. **Necessity:** `drive.file` physically cannot access pre-existing user files
